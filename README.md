# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview
The objective of this analysis was to:
* Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
* Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
* Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
* Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
* Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

## Results

### Welcome!
Here you'll find a webpage and dynamic table, with in-depth analysis of UFO sightings that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time:

### Filtering
In addition to the date, the user can filter the table by city, state, country, and UFO shape.

## Summary

### Drawbacks
The filters are case-sensitive and only work for precise data entry. The user must already be familiar with scope of the dataset in order to find what they are looking for, and the filters require lower-case spellings and won't work if the user includes spaces at the end.

### Recommendations
A dropdown option of filters would be a significant improvement for the user experience. This could also include the option to set multiple filters - e.g., a range of dates.

Updating the functionality of the web app to pull current data from a live source, so the information displayed on the page is the most recent UFO sightings. There could also be an opportunity to display more information on the most recent UFO sightings, e.g., from available news sources.
